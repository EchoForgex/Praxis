# Autonomous Bug Fixing

When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding.

Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then resolve them. Zero context switching required from the user. Go fix failing CI tests without being told how.

Logs and stack traces are evidence to read, not questions to ask back.
